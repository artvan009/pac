NAME
    App::proxyforurl - An online proxy PAC file parser

VERSION
    0.06

DESCRIPTION
    App::proxyforurl is a web application that can be used to test proxy PAC
    files.

    The server side is used to serve the web page, but does also provide
    functionlity for resolving hostnames and checking if an IP is within a
    given net.

  Demo
    Check out <http://home.thorsen.pm/proxyforurl> for a running example.

  Missing features
    The client side PAC parser does not fully support "dateRange()",
    "timeRange()" or "weekdayRange()". These functions simply return true,
    no matter what the intput is.

SYNOPSIS
      $ proxyforurl --listen http://*:8080;

  DISCLAIMER
    The parsing is done using good old "eval()" on the client side, which
    means that the pasted PAC file could in theory contain code which could
    steal cookies, inject alien JavaScript or do other harmful things.

    There is a safety net installed to prevent this from happening, but
    since this is software, there might be bugs.
