=head1 NAME

App::proxyforurl - An online proxy PAC file parser

=head1 VERSION

0.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<App::proxyforurl> is a web application that can be used to test proxy PAC
files.

The L<server side|Mojolicious> is used to serve the web page, but does also
provide functionlity for resolving hostnames and checking if an IP is within
a given net.

=head2 Demo

Check out L<http://home.thorsen.pm/proxyforurl> for a running example.

=head2 Missing features

The client side PAC parser does not fully support C<dateRange()>, C<timeRange()>
or C<weekdayRange()>. These functions simply return true, no matter what the
intput is.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ proxyforurl --listen http://*:8080;

=head1 DISCLAIMER

The parsing is done using good old C<eval()> on the client side, which means
that the pasted PAC file could in theory contain code which could steal
cookies, inject alien JavaScript or do other harmful things.

There is a safety net installed to prevent this from happening, but since
this is software, there might be bugs.
